# Win10script
This is the Ultimate Windows 10 Script from a creation from multiple debloat scripts and gists from github forked from Chris Titus Tech's github

## My own tweaks
- Removed Programs from Titus list
- UI Tweaks


## To install, right click windows and open Powershell as admin and copy this command:

powershell -nop -c "iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://git.io/JJucQ')"
